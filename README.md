# Solidity-Bootcamp

A cohort based Solidity-Bootcamp by Rise In - containing a list of small projects and a bigger project. This repo showcases my learnings.

These "little projects" were accumulative and interreleated to build one big voting proposal smart contract ("bigger project") -
Whereby the owner of the contract can create proposals and let other users vote (approve, reject, pass).

It is a project that gave one a generalistic view into governance.

You can use this smart contract with business partners to vote at Annual General Meeeting.

It can be used in competitions for auditons. The use-case scope is wide.
